# Express Authentication System with Passport

This project illustrates a basic authentication system developed with Express.js, Passport.js middleware, and Mongoose for MongoDB integration. The primary objective of this system is to validate users and grant them access to protected routes based on their credentials.

## How It Works

### Components:
- **Express.js**: A versatile and lightweight Node.js web application framework utilized for routing and middleware management.
- **Passport.js**: An authentication middleware for Node.js, offering support for various authentication methods, including the local strategy (username and password authentication).
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data.

### Workflow:

1. **User Registration**:
   - Upon user registration, the system collects their username and password via a form submission.
   - The provided credentials are stored in the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
   - Passwords are securely hashed using `passport-local-mongoose`, a Passport plugin simplifying authentication with Mongoose models.

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Passport's local strategy is configured to authenticate users based on the provided username and password.
   - Upon login attempt, Passport verifies the existence of the username in the database and authenticates the password.
   - Upon successful authentication, the user is redirected to the profile page; otherwise, they are redirected back to the login page.

3. **Session Management**:
   - Express session middleware handles user sessions.
   - After successful authentication, Passport serializes the user instance into the session.
   - During subsequent requests, Passport deserializes the user from the session, making it accessible in `req.user`.

4. **Protected Routes**:
   - Middleware function (`isLoggedIn`) protects routes that require authentication.
   - If an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected route, they are redirected to the login page.
   - Authenticated users are granted access to the requested route.

5. **Logout**:
   - When a user logs out, their session is terminated, and they are redirected to the home page.

## Purpose of Authentication System

The authentication system serves several critical purposes:

- **User Identification**: Verifies users' identities by validating their credentials.
- **Access Control**: Restricts access to specific application areas to authenticated users only.
- **Security**: Enhances data security by securely hashing and storing passwords.
- **Session Management**: Maintains user sessions, enabling users to remain authenticated across multiple requests without re-authentication.
- **Personalization**: Facilitates personalized user experiences by associating user-specific data and settings with authenticated sessions.

Overall, the authentication system enhances web application security and usability by authenticating users and controlling access to sensitive resources.
